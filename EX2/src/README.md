# Ex2 - The tic tac toe game with three strategies players
This program is a three-player Tic Tac Toe game with each player having a different playing style.  
The first player, "Whatever Player," places marks randomly.  
The second, "Clever Player," tries to win by placing their mark next to their last one.  
The third, "Genius Player," beats "Clever Player" by placing their mark in a specific order around their last spot: first right, then left, down, and finally up, if possible.
