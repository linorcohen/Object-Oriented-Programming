# Ex1 - ChatterBot exercise
ChatterBot exercise. The bot's replyTo method receives a statement.  
If it starts with the constant REQUEST_PREFIX, the bot returns whatever is after this prefix.  
Otherwise, it returns one of a few possible replies as supplied to it via its constructor.  
In this case, it may also include the statement after the selected reply (coin toss).
