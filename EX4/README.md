# Ex4 - A program for converting images to ASCII art.
Designed to take an image and render it as ASCII art by mapping the brightness of different parts of the image to characters with corresponding brightness levels.  
This involves dividing the image into smaller sections (sub-images), calculating their brightness, and then finding the best-matching ASCII character for each section based on brightness.
